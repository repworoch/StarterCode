What is a repository?

A repository can be thought of as a "folder of code" but with the following additional benefits: 

1. it can be shared with others, 
2. it can be branched/"forked" by others as a starting point for their own code, and 
3. all changes are tracked over time (allowing you to go back and "undo").  

If you are the owner of a repository, you can control who gets to see the code (view), who gets to change it (write/edit), and who gets to suggest modifications to it (view and submit 'pull requests').

The README.md file in each repository should explain the nature and purpose of the repository.  The README is written in a language called "<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">MarkDown</a>" (.md)  Those of you familiar with "mark _up_ " languages (i.e. HTML) will appreciate the humor and be ready to explore; those who aren't, know that you can write text as simple text or you can add additional special characters to provide formatting clues (text _italics_, __bold__, etc.).  You can even insert <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"> random HTML tags </a> as you go.
